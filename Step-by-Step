First thing I did was get the data I needed from www.pro-football-reference.com/super-bowl
Once I got the data I opened it in Excel and made sure everything was clean and what I needed
I am currently looking for any aditinal data I may like to use
List of data to find
-Last 10 years (seperate quick graph for more recent games)
-team with the most wins
-team with the most losses 
-Highest scoring game
-largest score gap
-highest single game revenue
-longest running game
started to clean and organize the data in R however I ran into a issue with getting it into Tableau so I did it in MySQL and it turned out much better.
